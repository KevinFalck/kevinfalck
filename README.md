# 👋 Hi, I'm Kévin.

### I don't just write code. I build products that sell.

I'm a **FullStack Architect** focused on high-performance web & mobile applications. My goal is simple: bridge the gap between complex engineering and seamless user experience.

### 💡 My Philosophy

> *"Code is a liability. Functionality is an asset."*

I believe in:
1.  **Pragmatism over Hype:** Choosing the right tool for the job, not the newest one.
2.  **User-Centric Architecture:** Performance is a feature. Accessibility is a must.
3.  **Shipping:** Perfection is the enemy of done. I ship, I iterate, I improve.
